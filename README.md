Observing the data for the ten weekdays prior to 7/21/2022, we can see that the customer's energy usage peaks in the late afternoon and early evening, with the highest usage occurring between 5-7pm. This suggests that the customer may be using energy-intensive appliances, such as air conditioning or cooking appliances, during this time. Additionally, the customer's energy usage drops significantly overnight, indicating that they may have implemented energy-saving measures such as turning off non-essential appliances. Overall, the data suggests that the customer may benefit from implementing further energy-saving measures during peak usage hours to reduce their electricity bill.
